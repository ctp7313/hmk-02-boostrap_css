Bootstrap/CSS Website README
2020.06.21
Documented by Chris Parker

For this project, we were assigned to create a website portfolio using CSS and Bootstrap. I've made three pages: Home, Portfolio, and Contact.

HOME:
    -What I did-
    I was able to make a container with a header, line, and image with text block on the same row. Was able to get the desired outcome with a few shortcomings detailed below

    -What went well-
    I felt I was able to successfully clean up my code and adjust the .css with custom styling to override Bootstrap. My navbar works well and is responsive to scaling of browser window.

    -What didn't go well-
    For some reason, and this will be reflected throughout the rest of the site, I'm unable to call my .css file properly. When using viewing through developer tools, styling all reflected as designed but in production, nothing seemed to show up. Will need to get into the habit of commiting often and early to properly address these issues.
    Unable to get my text to wrap properly around the image. Found some links that may work and will continue to update this.
