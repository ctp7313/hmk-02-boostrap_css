Bootstrap/CSS Website README
2020.06.21
Documented by Chris Parker

For this project, we were assigned to create a website portfolio using CSS and Bootstrap. I've made three pages: Home, Portfolio, and Contact.
Overall, this assignment was very challening. With enough time and documentation, I feel confident I could improve this site over time.


HOME:
-What I did-
I was able to make a container with a header, line, and image with text block on the same row. Was able to get the desired outcome with a few shortcomings detailed below

-What went well-
I felt I was able to successfully clean up my code and adjust the CSS with custom styling to override Bootstrap. My navbar works well and is responsive to scaling of browser window.

-What didn't go well-
Unable to get my text to wrap properly around the image. Found some links that may work and will continue to update this. Will need to learn more about alignments and other behaviors for text, modifyin the CSS, etc.


PORTFOLIO:
-What I did-
Successfuly made 3 rows of 2 images each with flexbox alignment. When the window is adjusted, images carry over to next row.

-What went well-
I felt i was able to get this page up and running relatively quick. I feel I have a good grasp on rows and columns, but I've still got some learning to do. This page seemed to have the least amount of effort needed to get to a presentable place.

-What didn't go well-
There seems to be some alignment issues when shrinking the window. They lose their alignment and look as if they lean more to the right. I wonder if this has to do with the adjustments I made to the .container within the CSS. I'd like to figure out how to get the images to scale bigger when it's just 1 to a row. Perhaps this needs to be done with larger assets and classes that shrink them down to size.
Also want to figure out how to get a banner over images to then show text according to the examples in the homework.


CONTACT:
-What I did-
I was able to take code from the Bootstrap site and adjust to me needs. I now have three fields with a submit button. All fields have ids associated with them for further coding to collect data.

-What went well-
This page by far felt like the most presentable. I felt it very responsive and I felt I had a good grasp on the changes I was making and how they affected things.

-What didn't go well-
I'd like to understand xs, sm, md, lg, xl better and how various column widths interact with them. With some more time I'd like to address the margin to the right of the container. Perhaps that's aesthetically acceptable.
